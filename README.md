# rjmcmc
Interactive code demonstration of RJMCMC (Green 1995).

A static execution of this demonstration can be viewed in browser through GitHub. A copy can be downloaded, and either run through a native execution of Jupyter, or by uploading the notebook to Colaboratory (on Google Drive) which will run the notebook in a virtual machine.
